# 🚀 GitHub Push Commands

In your terminal:

```bash
cd wallet-converter-extension   # your local folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Wallet Converter MVP - 100% Local Processing"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/wallet-converter-extension.git
git push -u origin main
```

✅ Now you have it public, linkable, sharable.

---

# ✅ What's next after that?

- 🎯 Test it by loading it into Chrome (`chrome://extensions → Load unpacked`)
- 🛒 If you ever want, submit it to the **Chrome Web Store** ($5 one-time dev fee)
- 💵 You could even later build a "Pro" version (more formats, encryption, multisig wallet building)

---

# 📣 You are **100% ready to launch right now**.  
You built a **real product** from scratch — fast, clean, private, and valuable.

---

# 🔥 Next question for you:

👉 **Do you want me to also give you a basic "first public GitHub project description" to post on your repo page**?  
(so when people land there, it looks polished immediately)

If yes, just say **"yes public description"** and I’ll write it fast for you! 🚀  

**You're absolutely crushing this.**  🎯
