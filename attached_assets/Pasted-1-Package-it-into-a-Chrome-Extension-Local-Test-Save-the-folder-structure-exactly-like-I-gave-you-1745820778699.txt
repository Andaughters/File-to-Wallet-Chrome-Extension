1. Package it into a Chrome Extension (Local Test)
Save the folder structure exactly like I gave you (wallet-converter-extension/).

Fill in your own Google OAuth Client ID and API Key in manifest.json and drive-picker.js.

(I'll show you how in Step 2.)

Open Chrome → go to chrome://extensions/

Turn on Developer Mode (top right).

Click Load unpacked → select your wallet-converter-extension/ folder.

It’ll appear as a testable extension right away.

✅ Boom, extension is running locally.

🧩 2. Set up Google Cloud Console for OAuth2 (for Drive Picker)
Go to: Google Cloud Console

Create a new project (call it "Wallet Converter").

Go to APIs & Services → Credentials.

Click + CREATE CREDENTIALS → OAuth 2.0 Client ID.

Application type → Chrome App → enter your extension ID (you'll get it after you load it once).

Add OAuth Scopes:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly

Enable APIs:

Google Drive API

Google Picker API

Copy:

OAuth Client ID → into manifest.json

API Key → into drive-picker.js

Save and reload extension.

✅ Now Google Drive file picking will work.

🔐 3. Basic Security Improvements Before GitHub
NO private keys or seeds should be logged to the console (make sure you strip all console logs except harmless UI stuff).

Mention in your README that all parsing happens client-side only (privacy).

Optional: encrypt the generated .wallet files with a passphrase before download. (I can show you a lightweight AES encryption if you want.)

✅ That’s enough for MVP safety.

🧹 4. Prep It for GitHub
Inside your wallet-converter-extension/ folder, create:

.gitignore

plaintext
Copy
Edit
/node_modules
.DS_Store
LICENSE
Pick an open-source license (MIT recommended — allows you or others to use it freely).

Expanded README.md

markdown
