Good — you're thinking **one step ahead** 🔥.  
Once you finish building it locally (which you're very close to), you **don't "install"** it the traditional way like a normal Chrome extension from the Web Store —  
you **"load" it manually into your Chrome browser**.

Super easy. Here's **exactly how**:

# 🛠️ How to Install and Test Your Chrome Extension Locally

### 1. Make sure your final project folder looks like this:

```
wallet-converter-extension/
├── manifest.json
├── popup.html
├── popup.js
├── wallet-builder.js
├── styles.css
├── icons/
│   └── icon.png
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── .gitignore
```
✅ (No extra junk — clean.)

---

### 2. Open Google Chrome

- Go to your URL bar and type:
  
  ```
  chrome://extensions/
  ```

- Press **Enter**.

✅ This opens the Extensions manager page.

---

### 3. Turn ON Developer Mode

- In the top-right corner, there’s a toggle for **Developer mode**.
- **Turn it ON** (must be ON to load your own extension manually).

---

### 4. Click "Load Unpacked"

- You’ll see a button at the top: **"Load unpacked"**  
- Click it.
- It’ll open your file browser.

---

### 5. Select your extension folder

- **Navigate to your project folder** (`wallet-converter-extension/`)
- **Select the folder**, not the files inside — the whole folder.

✅ Chrome will automatically recognize your `manifest.json`  
✅ The Wallet Converter extension will appear instantly in your extensions list.

---

# 🖥️ What happens after that:

- You'll see your extension listed in Chrome.
- You can **pin** it to the toolbar by clicking the puzzle piece 🧩 and pinning it.
- When you click your extension icon, your **popup.html** will launch — ready to drag-and-drop files and generate wallets!

✅ Full local install done.  
✅ Testable immediately.

# 📋 Summary of Steps:

| Step | Action |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | `chrome://extensions/` |
| 2 | Turn on Developer Mode |
| 3 | Click "Load unpacked" |
| 4 | Select your extension project folder |
| 5 | Done — extension installed locally! |

---

# 🚨 Important notes:

- Every time you **change code**, you must hit the **"Reload"** button on the extension card in `chrome://extensions/`.
- If you later want to **publish to the Chrome Web Store**, you'll zip the folder and upload it to Google's Developer Console ($5 one-time fee).

---

# 🎯 After you install locally:

- Test file uploads
- Test wallet generation
- Test download of `.wallet` file
- Import `.wallet` into Electrum desktop to fully confirm it works

✅ Then you're fully production-ready.

# 📣 So:  
👉 **Once you finish the final version**,  
👉 **Follow the steps above**,  
👉 **You’ll be live inside your own Chrome immediately**.

You're seriously inches from full launch! 🏁
